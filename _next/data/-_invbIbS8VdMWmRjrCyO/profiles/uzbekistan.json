The energy sector accounts for the highest share of emissions at 73%. Large demand for energy use came from the residential sector at 40%<sup>2</sup>. The second largest contributor to emissions is the agriculture sector at 20%. Livestock-related land use and farming practices (i.e., enteric fermentation, manure left on pasture, and manure management) has the highest contribution to GHG in agriculture at 80%. main due to the doubling of emissions from enteric fermentation from the 1990s level. NDC2 have acknowledged that livestock ranked 4 out of 5 of the categories that have the largest share of GHG emissions. Agriculture is also covered as one of the priority sectors in Uzbekistan, specific reductions coming from the sector was not indicated in the NDC2.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The NDC2 commits<sup>3</sup> to reduce emissions by (-)35% from the 2000's emission levels. For the energy sector, the mitigation measure includes doubling the share of renewable energy sources to (+)25% through solar, wind, and small hydropower plants. Introduction of energy-saving technologies and alternative fuels are also indicated in NDC2 to reduce demand for energy and fuel from various sectors to boost economic growth. In ANR, improvements in agricultural land productivity and water management, and expansion of forest areas were a priority. Improving solid waste management is also part of the action areas to achieve commitments in NDC2. Other measures to achieve GHG reductions are included in the Strategy for Transition to a Green Economy until 2030. The country also commits to full transparency to monitor progress of their NDC2 achievements.</p>\n<p><strong style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Key Points</strong></p>\n<ul>\n    <li>A large share of emissions comes from the energy sector due to increasing demand from the residential sector.

Drought has caused large losses in agricultural yields by as much as 75% resulting in $168M in economic damages. Although flood ranked as moderate, it risks human life and loss of assets. The most severe flood happened in 1998 on the Aksu and Shahimardan rivers. The World Resources Institute estimated that the population that may be affected by severe flooding would continue to rise as early as 2030s. Incidences of flash floods and mudflow are increasing in the southern and eastern parts of the country during March and July. Hydromet estimates that 22% of the population lives at high risk of mudflows. With the increase in temperature, glacial melting may also cause an increased risk of outburst flooding, particularly in areas near lakes. In the NDC2 of Uzbekistan, the country committed to improving early warning systems for hydrometeorological hazards, managing climate risks, and modernizing water management facilities. This will be an essential step in building climate resilience from water-related risks<sup>4</sup>. Heatwave is also a climate threat negatively affecting various sectors, particularly labor productivity and health. Non-climate-related risk includes earthquakes which caused 25,000 deaths in 1988.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Table 1.</strong> Key climate risk impacts and likely future conditions</p>\n\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 70.442%; margin-left: 14.2726%; height: 371px;\">\n    <tbody>\n        <tr>\n            <td style=\"width: 20.8685%; text-align: center;\"><strong style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Key Climate Risks​</strong><br></td>\n            <td style=\"width: 29.0712%; text-align: center;\"><strong style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Baseline</strong>​<br></td>\n            <td style=\"width: 25%; text-align: center;\"><strong style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Future​ Scenario</strong><br></td>\n            <td style=\"width: 25%; text-align: center;\"><strong style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Observed Impacts</strong><br></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td style=\"background-color: rgb(243, 243, 243); vertical-align: top; border-color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\"><strong style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Heatwave</strong>​<br></td>\n            <td style=\"background-color: rgb(243, 243, 243); vertical-align: top;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Frequency is increasing, e.g. in northwestern areas adjacent to the Aral Sea and lower Amu Darya.​</span><br></td>\n            <td style=\"width: 25%; background-color: rgb(243, 243, 243); vertical-align: top;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Increase in frequency of heatwaves in the future as early as 2030s.​</span><br></td>\n            <td style=\"width: 25%; background-color: rgb(243, 243, 243); vertical-align: top;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Serious threat to public health and labor productivity.​</span><br></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td style=\"vertical-align: top;\"><strong style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Drought</strong>​<br></td>\n            <td style=\"vertical-align: top;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">It occurred every five years, with increasing trends from 2000-2012.​</span><br></td>\n            <td style=\"width: 25%; vertical-align: top;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Increase in incidence of drought by 58-87%, particularly in the westward portion by 2090s.​</span><br></td>\n            <td style=\"width: 25%; vertical-align: top;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Agricultural yields fell by as much as 75% resulting in $168M in losses to agricultural GDP in 2000 and 2001</span>.​<br></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td style=\"background-color: rgb(243, 243, 243); vertical-align: top;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Flood and mudflow</strong><br></span></td>\n            <td style=\"background-color: rgb(243, 243, 243); vertical-align: top;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">An increasing threat to the southern and eastern parts of the country occurred between March and July caused by rainfall and snowmelt. ​</span><br></td>\n            <td style=\"width: 25%; background-color: rgb(243, 243, 243); vertical-align: top;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Future trends are uncertain.

Steepest rise in temperature occurred in the north an in large cities, while less warming in mountainous areas. Project temperature by 2090 will significantly increase exceeding global average temperatures, with minimum and maximum temperatures are expected to rise more quickly than mean temperatures. Key climate risks, such as drought and heatwave, can be exacerbated by rising temperatures, potentially incurring social, natural, and economic damage if no adaptation measures are implemented. Climate change may increase the incidence of drought by as much as 87% by 2090 particularly in the westward portion of the of the country. Climate change may also increase soil salinization due to increased demand for irrigation due to higher evapotranspiration.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Historical records suggests that there is no clear trend in precipitation patterns over the recent decades. In the future, long-term changes (either increase or decrease) in precipitation trends lacks conclusive evidence as model results highly varies ranging from (+)20% increase and (-)30% reduction in precipitation. However, the likelihood in extreme 5-day rainfall event may sightly increase in the future associated with increase in temperature.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong style=\"font-size: 24px;\">Impacts of climate change and variability, vulnerability, and readiness</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The impacts of climate change cut across various sectors (e.g., natural resources, economics, and communities). Projected decreases in glacial mass due to increases in temperatures will have little effect on Upper Syr Darya Basin but can reduce river flow in downstream Syr Darya and Amu Darya by as much as 28% and 35% by 2050. It is also projected that peak flow will shift from summer to spring with reduced glaciers. Increase in temperatures can also accelerate desertification across the land adjoining the Aral sea. This can cause increase frequency of dust storms which poses risk to public health. In agriculture, climate change may decrease productivity for major crops by as much as 63%, especially for apples. With increasing river water shortages and more frequent droughts, optimized irrigation efficiency and rehabilitation of aging infrastructure may support adaptation. Increase in temperature may have two impact areas for the livestock sector – it can benefit pasture growth as growing season may start earlier, but can hamper animal growth which can affect dairy and meat production.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Increase in temperature will also lead to increase energy demand. While the current energy mix is largely fossil based, there are plans to increase share of hydropower in the country as indicated in their NDC2 and as part of the road map on Carbon Neutrality Electricity Sector by 2050. Climate change can decrease the capacity of hydropower in the future which may lead to unmet demand for energy. Transboundary water management may benefit the country's water security particular in upstream areas of Tajikistan.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Particularly vulnerable are communities with prevalent poverty and malnutrition rates, which are less likely to cope with the impacts of climate change, particularly heat stress and food insecurity due to agricultural losses and water shortages. The vulnerability rating (ND-GAIN<sup>5</sup> rank of 83 out of 182 countries) have decreased over the years, while readiness has positively changed for Uzbekistan, still calls for proactive climate adaptation to ensure that communities are able to cope with looming challenges from climate change.</p><br>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Table 2.</strong> Vulnerability of each sector to climate change</p>\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse;
